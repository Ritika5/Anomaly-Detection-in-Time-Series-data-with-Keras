# Anomaly-Detection-in-Time-Series-data-with-Keras
Built an anomaly detection model using deep learning

Created this repository as part of Coursera hands-on project on 'Anomaly detection in Time Series data with Keras'.

Project Highlights:
1. Built an LSTM Autoencoder in Keras
2. Detected anomalies with Autoencoders in time series data
3. Created interactive charts and plots with Plotly and Seaborn

Designed and trained an LSTM autoencoder using the Keras API with Tensorflow 2 as the backend to detect anomalies (sudden price changes)
in the S&P 500 index.
